                  draft-birkholz-yang-comi-push-latest

Abstract

   This documents defines CoAP operations that implement the
   capabilities of YANG Datastore Subscriptions and YANG Customized
   Subscriptions for the CoAP Management Interface (CoMI).  The '/s'
   resource, as defined in CoMI, is extended analogously to include a
   set of sub-resources, each of them representing an observable
   resource identified by its subscription-id.  Specific additions
   include but are not limited to new FETCH Body definitions and
   simplified subtree subscriptions to intermediate data nodes in YANG
   datastore modules using SID.

1.  Introduction

   The YANG management interface for constrained devices and networks,
   called CoAP Management Interface (CoMI), is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-core-comi] and covers the capabilities as defined by YANG
   1.1 [RFC7950].  The most essential characteristics of CoMI are the
   use of:

   o  the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP [RFC7252]) to
      facilitate an HTTP-esque interaction model,

   o  the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR [RFC7049]) to
      facilitate an efficient content encoding using
      [I-D.ietf-core-yang-cbor], and

   o  YANG identifier strings are represented as numbers called YANG
      Schema Item Identifier (SID), also defined in
      [I-D.ietf-core-yang-cbor].

   This document defines additions to CoMI called Concise YANG Telemetry
   that:

   o  enrich its capabilities to subscribe to a variety of YANG modeled
      notifications--based on YANG Customized Subscriptions to a
      Publisher's Event Streams
      [I-D.ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications], and

   o  enable subscriptions to changes data note values in modules
      provided by the YANG datastore (or parts of them)--based on YANG
      Datastore Subscription [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push].

   Due to the utilization of CoAP, the interaction model of CoMI is
   quite similar to RESTCONF [RFC8040].  RESTCONF supports subscriptions
   to a YANG datastore via notification statements in YANG modules,
   which--when subscribed to via the base subscription YANG RPC defined
   in [RFC7950]--result in Series [I-D.bormann-t2trg-stp] of Server Sent
   Events [W3C.REC-eventsource-20150203]}.  A corresponding Event Stream
   specification for NETCONF [RFC6241] Event Notifications is defined in
   section 3.2.3 of [RFC5277].  To simplify corresponding terminology
   (and especially consolidate the impedance mismatch of the terms
   Notifications and Events), this document defines the following new
   term:

Internet-Draft                  CoMI Push                     April 2018


   YANG Telemetry:  A Series of YANG Notifications or YANG Notification
      Bundle Messages that are composed of YANG modeled data,
      potentially composing update records, sent from a YANG datastore
      to a YANG client either solicited or unsolicited in a fashion that
      can guarantee well-defined levels of Visibility with respect to
      Data Node Value changes.

   While the focus of YANG is typically on management and operations,
   the scope of YANG Telemetry extends into the Security Area with
   respect to Security Events.  Because of this, YANG Telemetry
   characteristics that address security requirements, such as
   Visibility and Resilient YANG Subscriptions, are addressed in this
   document.

   The definition of YANG Telemetry is based on the following existing
   terminology:

   Series:  Series Transfer Pattern are described in
      [I-D.bormann-t2trg-stp] and describe the conveyance of associated
      data items over time, where a client is able to obtain the Series
      and to learn about new items.

      YANG Customized Subscriptions or a YANG Datastore Subscription
      creates an specific Series Transfer Pattern composed of individual
      YANG Notifications or YANG Notification Bundle Messages that
      include related updated records.

   YANG Notification:  Defined in [RFC6241], a Notification is a server-
      initated message indicating that a certain event has been
      recognized by the server.

      While this definition is found in [RFC6241], which is based on
      YANG 1.0 [RFC6020], it also applies to the general definition of
      the YANG Notification statement in YANG 1.1 [RFC7950].

   YANG Notification (Bundle) Message:  An encapsulation header for one
      or more YANG notifications as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-netconf-notification-messages].  The message header
      includes a specific set of well-known objects, which are of
      potential use to networking layers prior being interpreted by some
      receiving application layer process.

      Examples include, but are not limited to: timestamps, signatures,
      or evidence about the integrity of the agents creating messages or
      notifications.

   Update Record:  A single YANG data item in a Series of YANG
      Notifications or YANG Notification Bundle Messages conveying the
      changes to a YANG datastore's module's Data Node Values.

   YANG Data Item:  An instance of YANG module Data Node Values or the
      changes to Data Node Values, conveyed as data in motion,
      serialized in a specific representation, such as XML, JSON, or
      CBOR.

   Visibility:  A level of assurance that Update Records will be
      received by a YANG Client.  There might be reasons, such as
      resource exhaustion or dampening settings, that result in Updates
      Records lost in transit or not being emitted by the YANG
      datastore.  Sequential Message-IDs or specific YANG Notifications
      are that report, e.g., about past events of resource exhaustion
      will inform the YANG Client about the characteristics of the loss
      of Update Records.

   Data Node Value:  Defined in CoMI as the value assigned to a data
      node instance.  Data node values are serialized into the payload
      according to the rules defined in section 4 of
      [I-D.ietf-core-yang-cbor].

2.  CoMI Push Terminology

   In addition to the illustration of the scope of YANG Telemetry above,
   this section highlights the most important terms that are vital to
   the functionality of CoMI Push.

   CoAP Requestor:  TBD

   CoAP Token:  TODO

2.1.  Summary of YANG Push Additions to CoMI

   This documents defines the Concise YANG Push binding to the CoAP
   Management Interface: a composition of mechanisms and YANG statement
   definitions that are described in YANG Push
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] and--in consequence--YANG Subscribed
   Notifications [I-D.ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] to the CoAP
   Management Interface.  In summary, these additions include:

   o  a CoAP POST operation to create, modify, delete or kill Telemetry
      subscription state,

   o  a CoAP PATCH operation to create, modify, delete or kill modify
      one or more Telemetry subscription states,

Internet-Draft                  CoMI Push                     April 2018


   o  a CoAP GET operation including the Observe option to receive a
      Telemetry stream,

   o  a CoAP FETCH operation including the Observe option to receive
      multiple Telemetry streams,

   o  an extension of the "/s" resource that includes sub-resource, such
      as subscription identifiers and corresponding SID instances, and

   o  the capability to direct GET and FETCH operations including the
      Observe option at resources that are sub-resources of "/c".

2.2.  Telemetry-Specific CoMI datastores

   The CoMI architecture assumes that both YANG client and YANG
   datastore (server) retain or have access to knowledge about the same
   YANG specification (see Figure 1 in [I-D.ietf-core-comi]).  This is
   not necessarily true for a YANG Push capable CoMI server.  Highly
   constrained nodes can emit series of subscribed notifications
   unsolicitedly; allowing them to create well-formed YANG-modeled
   Telemetry from hard-coded building blocks of YANG-modeled data, which
   are in compliance to YANG modules.  In consequence, while taking on
   the role of a YANG datastore, a YANG Push capable CoMI server SHOULD
   be capable to process YANG queries, but MAY not be due to the lack of
   corresponding functions or knowledge of a complete YANG module.

   As these flavors of YANG datastores are not necessarily able to
   create CoMI responses based on client request, it is likely that
   highly constrained datastores initiate a Call-Home procedure (see
   [insert NETCONF Call Home here]) acting as if a request was already
   received (see Configured Subscription above), enticing a very
   specific request they can fulfill (dynamic subscription) or
   rendezvous via a discoverable YANG Zero Touch component.  In all
   these use cases, the datastore intends to create device specific
   Telemetry to be collected by corresponding YANG clients.

   In essence, incorporating a complete YANG module is not required to
   enable the initiation of YANG Telemetry within a very specific scope.

3.  Subscription Content and State

   Two generic YANG notification statements for update records are
   introduced by YANG Push augments to enable the following
   capabilities:

   push-update:  A notification that includes a complete (and
      potentially filtered) update of data node values of YANG datastore
      nodes per the terms of a subscription.



Birkholz, et al.        Expires October 20, 2018                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                  CoMI Push                     April 2018


   push-change-update:  A notification that includes an incremental (and
      potentially filtered) update of data node values of YANG datastore
      nodes since the last (change-)update notification.

   Every update notification (bundle) in a Series that is the context of
   a subscription is emitted per the characteristics of the subscription
   state maintained by the YANG datastore.  Subscription state can be
   created on the YANG datastore during manufacturing, onboarding,
   enrollment, deployment, or maintenance of the YANG datastore.

3.1.  Selection Filter

   A vital part of the subscription state that defines the content of a
   Telemetry stream is the filter expression included in the
   subscription characteristics.  A filter expression enables a YANG
   datastore to emit only a subset of potential notification content;
   reducing the volume of data in motion, significantly.

   Two generic YANG Filter Expressions enable a YANG datastore to emit
   filtered subsets of data node value updates:

   Subtree Filter Expression:  A SID pointing to a specific data node in
      a YANG module (including notification statements) is used to
      create update records that include updates about the identified
      data node and its potential child nodes.  Effectively, a single
      SID points to the root node of the subtree update records are
      created for.

   XPATH Filter Expression:  A more detailed selection of SIDs and
      corresponding data node values that update records are created
      for.  The corresponding representation of XPATH Filter Expressions
      for COMI is defined in [I-D.ietf-core-yang-cbor].

4.  Subscription Characteristics

   Distinct YANG Telemetry streams are defined by the following three
   primary subscription characteristics:

   1.  Subscription Trigger (dynamic / configured)

   2.  Subscription Interval (periodic / on-change)

   3.  Subscription Type (stream / datastore)

   These characteristics define how subscription state is deployed and
   how the resulting Telemetry stream behaves.  As an example,
   corresponding subscription state can be created by a YANG client via




Birkholz, et al.        Expires October 20, 2018                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                  CoMI Push                     April 2018


   the "establish-subscription" RPC as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications].

4.1.  Subscription Trigger

   In general, to establish a Telemetry stream via YANG Push there are
   three options:

   1.  a YANG client starts to receive a Telemetry stream from a YANG
       datastore, unsolicitedly.  In this case, persistent subscription
       characteristics are created on the YANG data store before
       deployment, e.g. during onboarding, and come into effect directly
       after deployment.

   2.  a YANG client starts to receive a Telemetry stream from a YANG
       datastore, solicitedly.  In this case, persistent subscription
       characteristics are created on both the YANG client and the YANG
       datastore before deployment.

   3.  a YANG datastore initiates contact with a YANG client via a
       Rendezvous, Join, or Call Home procedure and triggers the
       initiation of a telemetry stream.  In this case, the subscription
       characteristics are configured on the YANG client and come into
       effect when the YANG datastore successfully discovered its home.

4.1.1.  CoMI Push Configured Subscriptions

   CoAP defines a strict coupling of request and corresponding response
   messages via the CoAP Token.  Every CoAP Request MUST include a CoAP
   Token that is generated by the requestor (client).  Analogously,
   every CoAP response that is associated with that request MUST include
   the corresponding CoAP Token in order for the CoAP Request not to be
   discarded,

4.1.2.  Dynamic Subscriptions

4.2.  Subscription Interval

4.2.1.  Periodic Subscription

4.2.2.  On-Change Subscription

4.2.2.1.  On-Change Subscription Prerequisites

   An On-Change Subscription capability MUST be explicitly annotated in
   a YANG module definition in order to prevent subscription to
   meaningless nodes.  E.g. it is advisable not to allow for
   subscriptions to YANG modules representing rapidly changing counters.

Internet-Draft                  CoMI Push                     April 2018


   The actual syntax and corresponding semantics of statements that
   intend to annotate On-Change Subscription capabilities is out-of-
   scope of [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] or
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] and in consequence also
   out-of-scope of this document.

4.2.2.2.  Visibility

   "publisher MUST set the "updates-not-sent" flag on any update record
   which is known to be missing information." * dampening-period MUST be
   set to 0 in order to ensure complete visibility * non-zero may just
   indicate that there was a change, but not which one (e.g. interface-
   flapping)

4.3.  Subscription Type

   The YANG Push subscription trigger mechanisms illustrated above
   create subscription state between a YANG client and a YANG datastore.
   As long as this subscription state between these two entities
   persists, a datastore can emit series of YANG notifications to a YANG
   client, if appropriate conditions are met, e.g. the YANG client
   expects solicited event notifications coming from the datastore due
   to a dynamic subscription.

   YANG Push [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] and YANG Subscribed
   Notifications [I-D.ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] extend this
   mechanism by enabling subscriptions to changes of YANG module data
   node state in a YANG datastore resulting in two types of sources - or
   two different types of YANG Notification Series [-cabo-series],
   respectively:

   o  event stream telemetry

   o  datastore changes telemetry

9.  YANG Push Operations for COMI

   Every subscription-id is created by the YANG datastore and is used in
   the corresponding subscription sate to provide the root identifier,
   by which dedicated subscription characteristics are associated with
   an established subscription.  In consequence, the basic interaction
   model of Concise YANG Push is split into two operations that are
   initiated by the YANG client in sequence:

   o  a PATCH operation on /c executing the establish-subscription RPC
      corresponding to the included PATCH body with content-type
      "application/yang-patch+cbo" that returns the subscription-id (or
      an error response)

   o  a GET Observe operation on the event stream resource /s/
      subscription-id or a FETCH operation on /s including a FETCH body
      with content-format "application/yang-selectors+cbor" and one or
      more subscription-id as content.  OR

Internet-Draft                  CoMI Push                     April 2018


   o  a GET Observe operation on /c/subscription-id to get subscribed
      notifications

   Please note, that Concise COMI Push allows SIDs to be used as
   subscription id.  There is more work to be done here to flesh that
   out.

9.1.  Extension of the CoMI Event Stream Resource

   A standard CoMI datastore as defined in [I-D.ietf-core-comi]
   typically uses the datastore resource "/c" to provide the YANG
   datastore tree and the resource "/s" to provide the YANG notification
   stream.  Sub-resources under "/c" are represented in the format of
   /c/sid.

   CoMI Push extends the scope of the "/s" resource.  Sub-resources
   under "/s" are represented as /s/key, where key is a numeric string
   representation of the subscription identifier, e.g. "/s/65536/".  The
   key representation reduces the ambiguity with respect to sid, which
   uses an URI safe base64 representation.

   Under each subscription identifier key provided as a sub-resource of
   the "/s" resource, a YANG tree instance of the subscription
   characteristics yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications/subscriptions (as
   defined in YANG Push [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push], which aguments
   ietf-subscribed-notification defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications]) is provided.  In the
   following example every sid is illustrated as a "string" as there is
   no sid for corresponding instance identifiers yet:

   /s/"65536"/"stream"/"within-subscription"/"filter-spec"/"stream-
   xpath-filter"/"stream-xpath-filter"

   This example would point to the filter selection associated with
   subscription id 65536.

9.2.  Extension of the YANG Subscription Mechanism

   YANG Push provides augmented RPC for establishing, modifying,
   deleting, or killing a subscription.  CoMI uses the same module as
   YANG Push and provides a corresponding interface to allow for a
   corresponding confirmable POST message to RPC resources (see
   [I-D.ietf-core-comi] Section 5.3.2.).

   CoMI Push also defines the capabilites to point confirmable FETCH
   messeges - including the Observe option - to sub-resources provided
   by "/c".  If the body of the FETCH message includes a CBOR modeled
   [I-D.ietf-core-yang-cbor] subtree filter expression, a new

   subscription is created and a corresponding subscription id is
   returned.  Additionally, a corresponding subscription sub-resource
   under "/s" is created.

10.  Upcoming Features and Stories

   o  maybe we should introduce /sn and /snmb for stream subscriptions
      and

   o  SIDs and subscription-id have to be both "the same" and
      "distinguishable" from sid

      *  maybe we have to create a new content-format application/yang-
         subest+cbor and application/yang-subres+cbor?

   o  my resource goes away during subscription (e.g.  FRU pulled)

   o  back channel liveness check - important for udp and sudden outage
      in telemetry flows
